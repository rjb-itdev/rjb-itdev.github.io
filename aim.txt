Aim:

The aim of this exercise is to use Angular.js.
It requires that you write an app that retrieves a
JSON data packet using Angular, and then display the
three items with their titles. Clicking on the title
of any of the items displays all the details for that
item (title, body, author) in another area on the same
page, without reloading the page.



Breakdown of tasks:

1.  Retrieve JSON data
    1.1 Iterate through data and grab the titles.
2.  Display Items with their titles
    2.1 display titles only
3.  Add functionality to display in same page without refreshing
4.  Make it look nice
    4.1 Include and use bootstrap

Start learning angular by reading documentation. :)



 The journey, started out with learning some angular js to achieve the
 tasks that I wanted.

 Using debug tools in chrome, and the non minified version of angularjs.
